# RaftShop
RaftShop is a distributed fault-tolerant system for e-commerce.

RaftShop has been implemented with Jolie, the first language for Microservices.
Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efÔ¨Åcient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos.
